/*
You're building a temperature checker. 
Given an array of temperatures, print a message for each temperature,
indicating whether it's warm or cold (assume warm if temperature is above 60°F).
 
Example input: [55, 80, 23, 77]

Example output:
55 degrees is cold
80 degrees is warm
23 degrees is cold
77 degrees is warm

//the temps
const temperatures = [38, 65, 25, 71, 57];

//your code here

//iterate through the array
for (i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
  //store each temperature in variable
  currentTemp = temperatures[i]
  //use a conditional to check if temperature is above 60
  if (currentTemp > 60) {
    //if it is, print out message indicating it is warm
    console.log(`${currentTemp} is warm.`)
  } 
  //if not, print out message indicating is is cold
  console.log(`${currentTemp} is cold.`)
}
